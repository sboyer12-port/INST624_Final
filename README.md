# MY FINAL PROJECT
# Sebastian Boyer
# Finance API using Alpha Vantage API

Run the project by down loading and inputing " python ./StockAnaluzer.py [ticker] (in place of ticker write the appropiate stock ticker example: AAPL)

# Project Scope

The goal of this project was to see API interaction. I have a lot of interest in Finance and not much ability to interact with many financial tools in my degree so I thought this would be a good introduction for me since there is a lot of freedom with this project. This project shows interaction with Alpha Vantages API to show the daily stock price trends of any public stock name that they have. It also shows a statisical summary of the stock as well.

# Documentation

Most of the documentation that I used to help me with this was found using the link below
https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/


# I have done most of my write up and now I am just going to be doing implementation


The goal of this python script is to receive the selected stock data by running the script through the terminal, adding
the name of a real stock at the end, and it accesses the API and then retrieves the selected information about the stock.

As requested in the requirments it is necessary to analyze the data and I will be using the matplotlib libary.
