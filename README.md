# MY FINAL PROJECT
# Sebastian Boyer
# Finance API using Alpha Vantage API

This is the beginning of my project.

My todos:

- first, find an API 
- second, figure out how to access
- third, experiment with accessing


# I have done most of my write up and now I am just going to be doing implementation


The goal of this python script is to receive the selected stock data by running the script through the terminal, adding
the name of a real stock at the end, and it accesses the API and then retrieves the selected information about the stock.

As requested in the requirments it is necessary to analyze the data and I will be using the matplotlib libary.
